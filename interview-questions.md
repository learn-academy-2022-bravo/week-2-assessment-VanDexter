representation# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: Parameters are defined in a function as a variable with a parenthesis and the argument is the code block to make the function work.

  Researched answer: Parameters are named variables in a function and an argument is the input to make the function work when invoked.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: .map() takes predefined parameters of an array in a function. Array, index and string are predefined parameters

  Researched answer: The value of the array (with the current iteration) in a function is required. Index and the array itself are optional inputs.  



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: map doesn't decrease the array length when returned but filter can.

  Researched answer: Filter will asses each item on an array and return a modified array based on the established argument. Map will execute an argument on an array and return the modified array with the same array length.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A method is a function stored within a function.  

  Researched answer: Methods are functions that are called upon by object properties. Methods can be determined by actions preformed on objects.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Isolates an object as it's own variable

  Researched answer: Object destructuring takes a variable keyword and uses an assignment operator to isolate nested objects.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: When you pull in JavaScript ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

  Researched answer: Hoisting in JS allows functions to be used before they are in a code. This feature allows you to declare variables, classes and functions on the "top" of your code snippet.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Classes that can inherit from other classes i.e parent-child classes.  

2. React: A program certain classmates are excited about apparently. It is a component based program that takes code and formulates a display.

3. React state: A built in feature in react that is use to house data and information on a given component

4. React lifecycle methods: Are methods in react for operating on components on DOM which is essentially a representation of HTML

5. DOM: A data structure that represents the UI of entered components in React.
